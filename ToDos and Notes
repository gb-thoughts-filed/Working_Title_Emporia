    #print and save starting date/time to disk
    #make a time loop that calls the next line for a whole hour or a whole day
    #counter saved after each time the function is called
    #print and save ending date time
    #email stuff

    ^^ Done!

#github repo, add Otman as a collaborator -- Done!

#rewrite codebase

#same thing with sparse solvers as dense solvers

#subspace approximation
    '''
    x lies in Rn, going to approximate it with z,
    z << x , m << n
    Linear subspace approximation, b of z - linear in z,

    PCA - principal component analysis

#while loop
res = a_Ldd@ udd - rhs

cho solve for dense matrices shelved this time
